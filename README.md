# Dungeons and Dragons with Python
## A text-based adventure game based on Dungeon and Dragons 5th Edition.
This game is my final project for the Coding 101 Summer Programme by Tufts University and the time constraint has led to most of the stats and abilities as well as game rules being tweaked to get an MVP (Minimal Viable Product) submitted on time but these will be reverted slowly as I spend more and more time working on this project. 

## Rules:
### Races:
### Aarakocra 🦅:
### Dwarf ⛰️:
### Elf 🧝:
### Gnome 😁:
### Halfling 🍀:
### Half-Orc 😤:
### Human 👨:
### Tiefling 😈:
